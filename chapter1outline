\title{Chapter 1: Data, the History of Bibliography and How, Exactly, They Both Ended up Here $\Downarrow$}
\author{Nigel Lepianka}
\maketitle

\begin{outline}
\1 What's Data?
	\2 Formal definitions
		\3 OIAS
			\4 Critique of
		\3 Divide between data and information
	\2 Literary/Humanistic definitions
		\3 Drucker- Data is social inscribed, a result of interpretation.
			\4 Captcha vs. Data. 
	\2 Metadata
		\3 Metadata sets standards, organizing principle, constricts. Differences are allowed within a defined set.
			\4 Would this make descriptive and analytical bibliography better for diversity? Individuality?
		\3 Underwood and why Literary Periods mattered could be useful here. Parameterization, e.g. enforcement of a metadata standard. 
\1 The Capacity for Bibliography to discuss data.
	\1 What are the principles of bibliography relevant here?
	\2 Evidence
		\3 Greg, Bowers, Tanselle, Gaskell, McKerrow
	\2 	
	\2 McKenzie: Bibliography as the field that discusses how information is modeled. 
		\3 Affordance of data, in that it is combinatorial, massively addressable.
		\3 Manovich
		\3 Earhart and McKenzie- rejection of holistic idea of text and its relation to rejection that the book is the center of bibliographical analysis. 
		\3 "Stretching a Point."- Against Inductive Reasoning of Evidence in Bibliography
			\4 Whitmore- Text as Massively Addressable
	\2 McLeod: redundancy in information is always a detail about it. That is, patterns are discernible clues. 	
\1 Data and the copy-text
	\2 Literary Data as based in transmission- always reliant upon the existence of pre-existing texts. 
\1 Transmission, Transformission, and the .txtual condition
	\2 Relate to Kirschenbaum
		\3 Clarify stance in relation to Kirschenbaum
			\4 Hardware-focused, not-visually
			\4 My stance: metadata, combinatorial, parameterized. 
	\2 McLeod- Information on Information
\1 On OCR
	\2 Tanselle- reproductions and scholarship
		\3 on the timeline among microfilm and photocopies
	\2 Errors
	\2 OCR treats all as equal- each text is run with the same parameters.
		\3 Mandell and the eMOP Project.
\1 Non-consumptive data as an edition
	\2 What is non-consumptive data and why does it exist?
		\3 Legal dimensions
		\3 Hathitrust and Underwood
		\3 Sag- "Grist for the Data-Mill"
			\4 Reveals the paradox of non-consumptive data from a legal standpoint.
	\2 How does the non-consumptive file exist: It is the end of a series of transmission and transformative processes
	\3 Cordell- "Qitb- the Raven" vs. Gailey (Automation vs. Manual debate)
	\3 Transmission as evidence 
\1 Case Study: Poe and the Non-Consumptive.
	\2 Recognition of the copy-text, evidence of transmission.
	\2 Poe and printing Pym, composition
	
\1 Moretti vs. McKenzie, or the case of the estranged godfather
	\2 Moretti as given basic credit for the field of distant reading.
		\3 Not to be confused with debates that would locate distant reading in pre-computational eras. 
	\2 McKenzie as the one to champion the use of dataset
		\3 Suarez- Extension of Evidence.
	\2 Enumerative Bibliography
		\3 This should lead to the discussion of Wright that centers the rest of the dissertation.

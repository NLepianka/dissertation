	abstract = {The phenomenon of library digitization in general, and the digitization of so-called "orphan works" in particular, raises many important copyright law questions. However, as this Article explains, correcdy understood, there is no orphan works problem for certain kinds of library digitization. The distinction between expressive and non-expressive works is already well recognized in copyright law as the gatekeeper to copyright protection--novels are protected by copyright, while telephone books and other uncreative compilations of data are not. The same distinction should generally be made in relation to potential acts of infringement. Preserving the functional force of the idea-expression distinction in the digital context requires that copying for purely non-expressive purposes (also referred to as non-consumptive use), such as the automated extraction of data, should not be regarded as infringing. The non-expressive use of copyrighted works has tremendous potential social value by making search engines possible, and by providing an important data source for research in computational linguistics, automated translation, and natural language processing. Furthermore, the macro-analysis of text is being increasingly used in fields such as the study of literature itself. So long as digitization is confined to data processing applications that do not result in infringing expressive or consumptive uses of individual works, there is no orphan works problem because the exclusive rights of the copyright owner are limited to the expressive elements of their works and the expressive uses of their works.},

Handsetting metal type necessarily focuses one's attention on the specificity of written language as a sequence of discrete letters. Each has properties of size, weight and shape; and placement and type styles can be widely varied. The technical constraints of letterpress tend to conserve the norm in the representation of language; line after straight line of a single typeface. The author's intention in deviating from these norms has been to extend, rather than negate or deny, the possibilities of meaning by encouraging plural readings at the level of the world, the line and the page. Other issues such as the relation of language to experience, to literary tradition or to the social context in which it is produced are investigated.},

What is the mystery of these innumerable editions of the Lamplighter, and other books neither better nor worse?—worse they could not be, and better they need not be, when they sell by 100,000. It may well be that no single passage written by Nathaniel Hawthorne is better known than this or, at least over the past few decades, more widely quoted.1 An extraordinary possibility, especially as the passage comes from the middle of a rather long private letter, written to his publisher and friend William D. Ticknor on January 19, 1855, and first published only in 1910.2 Nevertheless, this passage has resonated through recent discussions {ofAmerican} literary history, for it raises questions that are key to our understandings ofthat tradition: What is the relationship between popular success and literary quality? What role do gender politics play in our assessment of a work? In what ways have the economic factors facing authors and publishers fostered or discouraged authorship in the United States? And how is it that during the 185Os, a decade that came to be dubbed the "American Renaissance," sentimental novels could have enjoyed such popular success, while the "classics" by Hawthorne, Melville, Thoreau, and Whitman did not? Although he could hardly have thought in such terms, clearly these issues bothered Hawthorne as he pondered in what direction to continue his literary career. He returned to the subject in his very next letter to Ticknor, written two weeks later, but here at least he selects one of that "scribbling mob," Fanny Fern, for praise.3 His original outburst had been directed specifically at the work of another, Maria Susannah Cummins, whose best-selling novel The Lamplighter was making a tremendous success. Published in early March 1854, this work is reported to have sold 20,000 copies in twenty days, and 40,000 copies in eight weeks. By year's end, nearly 75,000 copies had been produced; by the end of the decade, total sales in the United States were somewhere around 90,000.4 Nevertheless, Hawthorne clearly exaggerated when in his exasperation he claimed that books written by women were selling by the hundred thousand. Although sales of The Lamplighter approached that figure, its success was exceptional, and its sales were not matched by other novels of the decade. The exception, of course, was Harriet Beecher 4 Michael Winship Stowe' s Uncle Tom 's Cabin, which indeed did sell in the hundred thousands— around 310,000 copies during the 1850s.5 Hawthorne's frustration is understandable. Consider his most popular work, The Scarlet Letter, which was published in March 1850: only 11,800 copies had been produced by 1860. For the short term at least, sales of his works had to be reckoned in the thousands instead of tens of thousands, much less hundreds of thousands. But as we pass the sesquicentennial of the original publication of The Scarlet Letter, it pays to look at the longer term. What was the publication history of the work for the remainder of the nineteenth century? And how does this history compare to that of Uncle Tom's Cabin! What can the comparison tell us about these works' subsequent histories and reputations? The story of the composition and original publication of The Scarlet Letter is well known.6 Hawthorne, who was an established writer of short stories and sketches, began work on the manuscript sometime—probably late summer —during 1849, the same year that he was dismissed from his job at the Salem Custom House. Before year's end, the Boston {publisherJames} T. Fields called on Hawthorne in Salem and came away with a draft of "The Scarlet Letter," which Hawthorne imagined as one of several stories in a collection to be called Old-Time Legends (or possibly The Custom-House). Fields encouraged Hawthorne...},

Entangled throughout the margins and fringes of books and other kinds of texts (especially visual ones), the paratext (e.g., citations, prefaces, typeface) has served as a field through which white supremacy has been transacted indirectly: white-written prefaces to fugitive slave narratives are vivid examples. At the same time, the paratext has also served as a vector through which white power has been resisted. Examining the paratextual issues surrounding Frederick Douglass's Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave and Without Sanctuary, James Allen's exhibition of lynching photography, this essay explores what is gained and lost when the paratext is used as a means of resisting racialized domination.},

	abstract = {Since "American renaissance" criticism emerged in 1876, it has derogated women's writings while idealizing men's, despite its shifting definitions of period, canon, and literary standards. My genealogy of the critical discourse of renaissance details ways that this criticism has denied literary value to women writers, especially at historical moments of women's increased publicity and apparent gains of power, thereby helping to maintain larger gender and racial hierarchies. Because of this tradition, I argue, the renaissance discourse is inadequate to current efforts to reenvision United States literary history and to a democratic culture.},

Lyon Book Award, Western Literature {AssociationIn} January of 1861, on the eve of both the Civil War and the rebirth of the African Methodist Episcopal Church's Christian Recorder, John Mifflin Brown wrote to the paper praising its editor Elisha Weaver: "It takes our Western boys to lead off. I amproud of your paper."Weaver's story, though, like many of the contributions of early black literature outside of the urban Northeast, has almost vanished. Unexpected Places: Relocating Nineteenth-Century African American Literature recovers the work of early African American authors and editors such as Weaver who have been left off maps drawn by historians and literary critics. Individual chapters restore to consideration black literary locations in antebellum St. Louis, antebellum Indiana, Reconstruction-era San Francisco, and several sites tied to the Philadelphia-based Recorder during and after the Civil War.In conversation with both archival sources and contemporary scholarship, Unexpected Places calls for a large-scale rethinking of the nineteenth-century African American literary landscape. In addition to revisiting such better-known writers as William Wells Brown, Maria Stewart, and Hannah Crafts, Unexpected Places offers the first critical considerations of important figures including William Jay Greenly, Jennie Carter, Polly Wash, and Lizzie Hart. The book's discussion of physical locations leads naturally to careful study of how region is tied to genre, authorship, publication circumstances, the black press, domestic and nascent black nationalist ideologies, and black mobility in the nineteenth century.},

G. Thomas Tanselle argues, on the contrary, that the two activities cannot be separated.The textual critic, in choosing among textual variants and correcting what appear to be textual errors, inevitably exercises critical judgment and reflects a particular point of view toward the nature of literature. And the literary critic, in interpreting the meaning of a work or passage, needs to be (though rarely is) critical of the makeup of every text of it, including those produced by scholarly editors. show less},

Since text is "authority" and "original" and yet also "network" and "tissue" and since forensics encompasses both hard physical "facts" and the rhetorical formulation that gives such data interpretive meaning, a textual forensics will codify and test the interaction of the phenomenological world and the hermeneutic analysis of its evidence. With procedural and conceptual links both to scientific empiricism and to rhetorical strategies for persuasion, textual scholarship becomes a vehicle for anatomizing the postmodernist breakdown of the master narratives, including that of evidence and proof.},

	abstract = {Identifying the type of font (e.g., Roman, Blackletter) used in historical documents can help optical character recognition ({OCR}) systems produce more accurate text transcriptions. Towards this end, we present an active-learning strategy that can significantly reduce the number of labeled samples needed to train a font classifier. Our approach extracts image-based features that exploit geometric differences between fonts at the word level, and combines them into a bag-of-word representation for each page in a document. We evaluate six sampling strategies based on uncertainty, dissimilarity and diversity criteria, and test them on a database containing over 3,000 historical documents with Blackletter, Roman and Mixed fonts. Our results show that a combination of uncertainty and diversity achieves the highest predictive accuracy (89\% of test cases correctly classified) while requiring only a small fraction of the data (17\%) to be labeled. We discuss the implications of this result for mass digitization projects of historical documents.},
